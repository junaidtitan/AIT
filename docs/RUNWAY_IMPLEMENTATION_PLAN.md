# RunwayML Implementation Plan for Director's Visual Features

## Executive Summary
Complete migration from Shotstack to RunwayML for AI-powered video generation with full Director's visual protocol implementation.

## Phase 1: Core RunwayML Integration (Day 1-2)

### 1.1 RunwayML Client Module
- Location: `src/produce/runway_client.py`
- Features:
  - Async API client with retry logic
  - Job management and polling
  - GCS caching for results
  - Error handling and fallback

### 1.2 Environment Setup
```bash
# Required environment variables (already in GCP Secrets)
RUNWAY_API_KEY=<stored_in_secrets>
USE_RUNWAY=true  # Toggle for Shotstack fallback
```

## Phase 2: Visual Director System (Day 3-4)

### 2.1 AI-Powered Visual Director
- Location: `src/produce/runway_visual_director.py`
- Capabilities:
  - Segment analysis and visual planning
  - AI B-roll generation prompts
  - Multi-layer composition
  - Style consistency enforcement

### 2.2 Visual Planning Pipeline
1. Analyze segment content and keywords
2. Determine visual requirements
3. Generate or source base assets
4. Plan overlay timings
5. Configure effects and transitions

## Phase 3: Logo & Text Overlay System (Day 5-6)

### 3.1 Smart Logo Placement
- Location: `src/produce/runway_overlays.py`
- Director's Requirements:
  - 3-4 second display duration
  - Subtle scale/fade animations
  - Upper corner positioning
  - First mention detection

### 3.2 Text Overlay Engine
- Styles Implemented:
  - Keyword overlays (futuristic font, neon glow)
  - Data points (large, pulsing, green)
  - Lower thirds (clean, gradient background)
  - Glitch effects (digital distortion)

## Phase 4: Screenshot Enhancement (Day 7)

### 4.1 Ken Burns Implementation
- Location: `src/produce/runway_screenshots.py`
- Features:
  - 30% zoom over duration
  - Smooth pan movements
  - Easing curves

### 4.2 Animated Highlighting
- Trace animation over text
- Synchronized with voiceover
- Yellow/cyan highlight colors
- Write-on effect

### 4.3 Holographic Frames
- Virtual monitor effect
- Scan lines and glow
- Chromatic aberration
- Futuristic aesthetic

## Phase 5: PiP & Advanced Layouts (Day 8)

### 5.1 Picture-in-Picture
- Location: `src/produce/runway_layouts.py`
- Layouts:
  - Corner PiP (25% scale)
  - Split screen (50/50)
  - Floating PiP (animated path)
  - Clean borders with glow

### 5.2 Transition Animations
- Smooth slide-in/out
- Fade transitions
- 8-10 second maximum duration
- No hard cuts

## Phase 6: Integration & Orchestration (Day 9-10)

### 6.1 Pipeline Integration
- Location: `src/produce/video_builder.py`
- Process Flow:
  1. Visual planning per segment
  2. Base asset generation/collection
  3. Overlay application
  4. Final composition with voiceover
  5. Export and caching

### 6.2 Shotstack Fallback
- Automatic failover on RunwayML errors
- Feature degradation handling
- Cost optimization for simple videos

## Phase 7: Testing & Validation (Day 11-12)

### 7.1 Unit Tests
- Location: `tests/test_runway_integration.py`
- Coverage:
  - Video generation
  - Overlay timing
  - Visual director logic
  - Fallback mechanisms

### 7.2 Integration Tests
- Full pipeline execution
- Visual quality validation
- Performance benchmarks
- Cost tracking

## Technical Specifications

### API Endpoints
```python
base_url = "https://api.runwayml.com/v1"
endpoints = {
    "gen3_turbo": "/gen3/turbo",        # Text-to-video
    "style_transfer": "/style",          # Style application
    "green_screen": "/greenscreen",      # Background removal
    "upscale": "/upscale",               # Resolution enhancement
    "compose": "/compose"                # Final composition
}
```

### Performance Targets
- Render time: < 2 minutes for 60s video
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (HD) minimum
- Frame rate: 30 FPS
- Overlay accuracy: 100%
- Fallback success: 100%

### Cost Estimates
- Gen-3 video: $0.05 per second
- Effects/overlays: $0.01 per operation
- Average 60s video: ~$4-5
- Monthly (30 videos): ~$150
