# Updated Plan — JunaidQ YouTube 2.0 (Aligned v0.2)

## Channel Focus
- **AI News only** (no evergreen content).
- **Target Audience**: High-CPM executives + people in the field (overlap).

## Video Formats (v1 → v3)
1. **Vid 1 (Daily Exec Summary)** — Fast recap of yesterday’s AI news for executives and practitioners.
2. **Vid 2 (Topic of the Day)** — Deep dive into a single major theme (e.g., “5 achievements in AI this month”).
3. **Vid 3 (Paper/Tool Review)** — Research paper breakdown or AI tool comparison.
4. **Vid 4 (Weekly Roundup)** — The drama, funding, spats, interviews, breakthroughs.

## Goals
- **12 months**: $30K/month revenue.
- **Effort**: 1–2 hours/day of manual approvals and reviews.
- **Consistency**: 3 daily videos + 1 weekly roundup by v3.

## Roadmap
- **v1 (0–3 months)**: Build Vid 1 (Daily Exec Summary).
- **v2 (3–6 months)**: Add Vid 2 (Topic of the Day) + Vid 3 (Paper/Tool Review); analytics + A/B testing.
- **v3 (6–12 months)**: Add Vid 4 (Weekly Roundup); monetization + scaling.

## Unfair Advantage
- Leverage best APIs (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Pictory/CapCut).
- Manual approvals for editorial control (Junaid in the loop).

## Costs
- Assume optimized unlimited budget (production-grade build).

## Scope Notes
- **No evergreen content.**
- **Focus on YouTube only** in v1 (LinkedIn, email, community come later).
- **Approvals mandatory**: topic, script, QC.
