# Google Sheets Service Account Setup

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Service Account Key Needs Recreation

The service account key file was lost during the git restore. Follow these steps to recreate it:

## üìã Prerequisites

1. Google Cloud Project with Sheets API enabled
2. Service account with appropriate permissions
3. Access to the Google Sheet: `1J4d4S0mnBeWn5hfHhnc97SPusn9ejz4jWE9oQtK0mgU`

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Service Account Key

```bash
# List your service accounts
gcloud iam service-accounts list

# Create a new key for your service account
# Replace SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL with your actual service account email
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create \
    /home/junaidqureshi/AIT/sheets_service_account.json \
    --iam-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
```

### 2. Alternative: Create via Console

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Navigate to IAM & Admin ‚Üí Service Accounts
3. Find your service account (or create new one)
4. Click on the service account
5. Go to "Keys" tab
6. Add Key ‚Üí Create new key ‚Üí JSON
7. Save as `/home/junaidqureshi/AIT/sheets_service_account.json`

### 3. Share the Google Sheet

1. Open the sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J4d4S0mnBeWn5hfHhnc97SPusn9ejz4jWE9oQtK0mgU
2. Click "Share" button
3. Add the service account email (found in the JSON key file)
4. Give "Editor" permissions
5. Click "Send"

### 4. Required Sheet Structure

The Google Sheet should have these tabs:

#### Sources Tab
| Column | Field | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| A | Name | OpenAI Blog |
| B | URL | https://openai.com/blog/rss.xml |
| D | Category | company |
| F | Priority | 10 |
| G | Enabled | Yes |

#### Companies Tab
| Column | Field | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| A | Company | OpenAI |
| B | Aliases | openai, open ai |
| C | Products | gpt, chatgpt, dall-e |

#### Scoring Tab
| Column | Field | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| A | Metric | news_freshness_1h |
| B | Weight | 40 |

#### Article Log Tab (auto-created)
Used for logging top articles back to the sheet.

#### Trending Tab (optional)
Created when YouTube trending is enabled.

## üß™ Test the Setup

```bash
# Test the connection
python3 -c "
from src.ingest.simple_sheets_manager import SimpleSheetsManager
import asyncio

async def test():
    manager = SimpleSheetsManager()
    sources = manager.get_sources()
    print(f'‚úÖ Connected! Found {len(sources)} sources')

asyncio.run(test())
"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Request had insufficient authentication scopes"
- The service account needs the Sheets API scope
- Recreate the key if needed

### "Permission denied"
- Make sure the sheet is shared with the service account email
- Check that the service account has Editor permissions

### Using Default Credentials Instead
If you can't create a service account key, the system will try to use Application Default Credentials:

```bash
# Authenticate with your Google account
gcloud auth application-default login

# Make sure you have access to the sheet with your account
```

## üìù Notes

- The service account email typically looks like: `name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- The JSON key file contains sensitive credentials - never commit it to git
- The system will fall back to hardcoded sources if Sheets access fails
- Sheet ID: `1J4d4S0mnBeWn5hfHhnc97SPusn9ejz4jWE9oQtK0mgU`
